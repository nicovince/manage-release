# manage-release

This action is inspried from [johnwbyrd/update-release](https://github.com/johnwbyrd/update-release) and tries to be compatible with it.

Since the original action was written using `node12` for which github dropped supports I decided to write my own action to manage release using a composite action based on bash shell scripts and [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/).

## Setup action
In your desired workflow (`.github/workflows/`), insert the following lines
```yaml

```
