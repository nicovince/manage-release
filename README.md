# manage-release

This action is inspried from johnwbyrd/update-release and tries to be compatible with it.
Since the original action was written using `node12` for which github dropped supports I decided to write my own action to manage release using a composite action based on bash shell scripts and [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/).

:warning: Development is still in progress.
